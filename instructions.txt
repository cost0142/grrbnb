In your version you may customize the colour(s), typography and header image. The layout must remain
 as shown above with a small, medium and large layout (breakpoints may be approximate to the gif). The Logo image is provided.

Pick an image from Unsplash Dog Search Results (opens new window). In your CSS add a comment about the source of your image. Then use a Chrome extension 
like ColorZilla or Photoshop to extract a two or three colours from your image. Use those colours as the background colour for your button plus the colours 
for the label and input text. Make sure that the button text and the button background have accessible contrast.

Make sure that all inputs, labels, and heading text use the same font.

Be consistent with your font sizes. Think about the typographic hierarchy.

Remember to put a text shadow on any text that is on top of a background image. Use two colours with high contrast. One for the text and one for the shadow.

Add a Google font with the @import syntax at the top of the CSS file.

You can use CSS Grid or Flexbox for your layout. Float should NOT be used.

You need to make the form responsive. There should be 3 different layouts, just like in the example image above.
